nvim-templator
==============

NeoVim plugin for writing boilerplate code for you.

Installation
============

Use your preferred plugin manager. Run `install.sh` as a post-installation step, which will download and install the pre-built MacOS binary.

For example, `vim-plug`:

```vim
Plug 'mathewcohle/nvim-templator', { 'do': 'bash install.sh' }
```
